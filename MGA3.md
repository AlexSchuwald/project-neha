### Question 2

A class of `234` students are arranged in rows such that the number of students in a row is one less than thrice the number of rows. Find the number of students in each row.

### Question 3

The product of two consecutive odd natural numbers is `255`. Find the largest number among them.

### Question 4

The slope of a parabola `y = 3 x^2 - 11 x + 10` at a point `P` is `7`. Find the `y`\-coordinate of the point `P`.

### Question 5

If the slope of the parabola `y = a x^2 + b x + c` at `(2, 3)` is `5` and the `X`\-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola is `3`, then which of the following is/are true?

### Question 6

The daily production cost (in lakh ₹) of manufacturing an electric device is `p(x) = 7400 - 60 x + 15 x^2`, where `x` is the number of electric devices produced per day and the daily transportation cost (in lakh ₹) of `x` number of electric devices is given by the slope of the function `p(x)` at point `x`. If the production cost on a particular day is `7475` (in lakh ₹), then find the number of electric devices produced on that day.

### Question 7

An Architect is designing an arch which is in the shape of figure M1W3-PARABOLA,  The details of the design are as follows:  Height of arch is `20m`, width of arch at height of `8m` is `4m`.  Consider the axis of symmetry as `x = 0`, find the equation of the arch.

The image M1W3-PARABOLAa graph of a quadratic equation, which is a parabola. The parabola opens downwards, meaning it has a U-shape that points downwards. The vertex of the parabola, which is the highest point on the curve, is located at (0, 20). The y-intercept of the parabola, where it intersects the y-axis, is also at (0, 20). The x-intercepts of the parabola, where it intersects the x-axis, are at approximately (-5, 0) and (5, 0). The graph is symmetric around the y-axis, meaning that if you fold the graph in half along the y-axis, the two sides will match

### Question 8

Consider three Airports A, B, and C. Two friends Ananya and Madhuri want to meet at Airport C. Ananya Boarded Flight 1 from Point A to C which is `1200 km`, due to bad weather, Flight 1 slowed down, and the average speed was reduced by `200 km/h` and the time increased by `30 minutes`. Madhuri boarded Flight 2 from Point B to C which is `1800 km`, the average speed of Flight 2 is \`

### Question 9

A water fountain is designed to shoot a stream of water in the shape of a parabolic arc. The equation of the parabola is given by h(t)= −0.5t^2 + 4t + 1, where h(t) represents the height of the water stream in meters and _t_  represents the time in seconds since the water was shot. Answer the following questions.\
Determine the time (in seconds) it takes for the water stream to reach its maximum height.

### Question 10

Which of the following options is/are true?

- [ ] **Statement 1:** The point at which the slope of the equation (x^2 + 2x - 5) equals 10 is (4,17).

- [ ] **Statement 2:** (x = 2) is the axis of symmetry of the quadratic function (f(x) = x^2 + 4x + 5).

- [ ] **Statement 3:** If two different quadratic equations have the same discriminant, then the roots of both equations can be the same.

- [ ] **Statement 4:** The point at which the slope of the equation (x^2 + 2x - 5) equals 10 is (4,19).
