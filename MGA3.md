2\. Question: A class of 2/3/4 students are arranged in rows such that the number of students in a row is one less than thrice the number of rows. Find the number of students in each row.

3\. Question: The product of two consecutive odd natural numbers is 255. Find the largest number among them.

4\. Question: The slope of a parabola `y = 3x^2 - 1/1 x + 1` at a point `P` is 7. Find the `y`\-coordinate of the point `P`.

5\. Question: If the slope of the parabola `y = ax^2 + bx + c` at (2, 3) is 5 and the `x`\-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola is 3, then which of the following is/are true?

6\. Question: The daily production cost (in lakh ₹) of manufacturing an electric device is `p(x) = 7400 - 60x + 15x^2`, where `x` is the number of electric devices produced per day and the daily transportation cost (in lakh ₹) of `x` number of electric devices is given by the slope of the function `p(x)` at point `x`. If the production cost on a particular day is 7475 (in lakh ₹), then find the number of electric devices produced on that day.

7\. Question: An Architect is designing an arch which is in the shape of figure M1W3-PARABOLA. The details of the design are as follows: Height of arch is 20m, width of arch at height of 8m is 4m. Consider the axis of symmetry as `x = 0`, find the equation of the arch.

8\. Question: Consider three Airports A, B, and C. Two friends Ananya and Madhuri want to meet at Airport C. Ananya Boarded Flight 1 from Point A to C which is 1200 km, due to bad weather, Flight 1 slowed down, and the average speed was reduced by 200 km/h and the time increased by 30 minutes. Madhuri boarded Flight 2 from Point B to C which is 1800 km, the average speed of Flight
