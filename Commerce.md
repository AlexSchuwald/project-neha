### 1\. **Initial Setup**

- [x] Set up a new Django project and app (`auctions`).

- [x]  Configure `settings.py` (e.g., install necessary apps like `crispy_forms` for better form handling).

- [ ]  Set up the database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL).

### 2\. **Model Design**

- [ ] Define the `AuctionListing` model.

- [ ]  Define the `Bid` model.

- [ ]  Define the `Comment` model.

- [ ]  Add any additional fields or models (e.g., categories).

- [ ]  Run `makemigrations` and `migrate` to apply model changes.

### 3\. **Admin Setup**

- [ ] Register models (`AuctionListing`, `Bid`, `Comment`) in `admin.py`.

- [ ]  Create a superuser using `createsuperuser`.

- [ ]  Test the Django admin interface to ensure models are correctly registered and manageable.

### 4\. **User Authentication**

- [ ] Review and test the `login_view`, `logout_view`, and `register` views provided in the distribution code.

- [ ]  Modify `layout.html` to customize the user experience based on whether the user is authenticated.

### 5\. **View Implementations**

- [ ] Implement the `index` view to display all active auction listings.

- [ ]  Implement the `listing_detail` view to show details of a specific listing, including bidding and comments.

- [ ]  Implement the `create_listing` view to allow users to create a new auction listing.

- [ ]  Implement the `watchlist` view to show all items added to the user's watchlist.

- [ ]  Implement the `categories` view to display all categories and their respective listings.

- [ ]  Ensure proper use of the `@login_required` decorator for protected views.

### 6\. **URL Configuration**

- [ ] Define URLs in `urls.py` for all the views (index, listing_detail, create_listing, watchlist, categories).

- [ ]  Ensure proper naming of URL patterns for easy reference in templates.

### 7\. **Forms Implementation**

- [ ] Create a `CreateListingForm` for users to create new auction listings.

- [ ]  Create a `BidForm` for users to place bids on listings.

- [ ]  Create a `CommentForm` for users to add comments to listings.

- [ ]  Integrate forms into corresponding views (e.g., `listing_detail`, `create_listing`).

### 8\. **Template Design**

- [ ] Create `layout.html` as the base template with navigation, footer, and conditional content.

- [ ]  Design `index.html` to list all active auction listings.

- [ ]  Design `listing_detail.html` to display listing details, bids, comments, and forms for interacting with the listing.

- [ ]  Design `create_listing.html` with a form to create a new listing.

- [ ]  Design `watchlist.html` to display items in the user's watchlist.

- [ ]  Design `categories.html` to display and link to listings in each category.

### 9\. **Watchlist Functionality**

- [ ] Implement the ability to add listings to the user's watchlist.

- [ ]  Implement the ability to remove listings from the watchlist.

- [ ]  Test to ensure that watchlist additions and removals work as expected.

### 10\. **Bidding Functionality**

- [ ] Ensure bids are only accepted if they meet the minimum criteria (starting bid, higher than existing bids).

- [ ]  Implement error handling for invalid bids.

- [ ]  Close the auction and declare a winner when the auction owner closes the listing.

### 11\. **Commenting Functionality**

- [ ] Allow signed-in users to add comments to a listing.

- [ ]  Display all comments on the `listing_detail` page.

### 12\. **Categories and Filtering**

- [ ] Implement functionality to filter listings by category.

- [ ]  Display a list of categories with links to filtered listings.

### 13\. **Django Admin Interface**

- [ ] Test adding, editing, and deleting listings, bids, and comments via the Django admin interface.

- [ ]  Ensure admin interface functionality aligns with the siteâ€™s needs.

### 14\. **Styling and UI/UX**

- [ ] Add CSS to improve the aesthetics of your templates.

- [ ]  Optionally, integrate a CSS framework like Bootstrap for responsive design.

- [ ]  Test the design across different devices and screen sizes.

### 15\. **Testing and Debugging**

- [ ] Test user registration, login, and logout functionality.

- [ ]  Test creating, viewing, and interacting with auction listings.

- [ ]  Test all edge cases (e.g., invalid bids, empty forms).

- [ ]  Ensure all views, forms, and templates work together seamlessly.

- [ ]  Debug any issues that arise during testing.

### 16\. **Final Touches**

- [ ] Review all code for best practices and clean up any unused or redundant code.

- [ ]  Add comments and documentation as necessary.

- [ ]  Consider adding unit tests for key functionality.

### 17\. **Deployment (Optional)**

- [ ] Prepare your project for deployment (e.g., set up environment variables, configure `settings.py`).

- [ ]  Deploy the site using a hosting service like Heroku or DigitalOcean.

- [ ]  Ensure all deployment settings are correct (e.g., DEBUG mode off, secure settings).

### 18\. **Post-Deployment**

- [ ] Test the live site to ensure all functionality works as expected.

- [ ]  Monitor the site for any issues or user feedback.

- [ ]  Implement any necessary updates or improvements based on feedback.
